<h3>Getting there</h3>
<p>
  IIMB is at the south end of Bangalore, about 2 km past the Outer Ring Road on Bannerghatta Road.
  If you are taking public transport, ask for “<strong>Honeywell</strong>”. Their campus is across the road. The bus
  stop next to IIMB’s entrance is “<strong>Apollo Hospital</strong>”. Bus routes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>G4</strong> Big10 bus from Brigade Road</li>
  <li><strong>365</strong> and <strong>369</strong> series from the Kempegowda bus stand at Majestic</li>
</ul>
<p>
  You will have to checkin with security when you enter. Turn right inside the gate and follow
  the road until it curves left, leading to a parking lot. You will find signboards there leading
  to the auditorium.
</p>
<h3>At the venue</h3>
<p>
  IIMB’s auditorium can seat 250 and has excellent acoustics. We will have WiFi for the event.
  However, the auditorium does not have power points near seats. We have structured the agenda
  such that you can follow it online, but don't have to.
