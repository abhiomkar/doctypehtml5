<h3>HTML5 101</h3>
<p>
  The basics of HTML5. Doesn't matter if you are grokking HMTL5 code for
  breakfast or just wetting your feet this session is for you. This session
  will tell you what is it, why is it important, who stands to gain and more.
  We will also cover who built this, who is responsible, what is possible
  and what are we going to cover in the following sessions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is HTML5?</li>
  <li>How do we reach here? Answering the question where we were with
  HTML/XHTML and now HTML5 and not XHTML2</li>
  <li>W3C Standards versus the browser people</li>
  <li>So what is possible with this shiny new thing</li>
  <li>A brief list what to follow in the next four sessions</li>
</ul>

<h3>Covering the basics</h3>
<p>
  Starting with the simple doctype. What is the HTML5 tech landscape 
  made up of. A brief overview canvas, geolocation, video, offline web
  applications, CSS3, drag and drop and elements/tags for semantic code
</p>

<h3>Demo time - Geolocation, Offline Storage, Canvas</h3>
<p>
  Applications that run on mobiles, newer browsers can find your geographic
  location. Other applications can provide a richer experience provided they
  can store their data in the browser. We will demo all of this and more.
  You will also get a chance to download the code being demoed to your laptops.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where you at? Geolocation magic with pizza ordering application and Trafficam</li>
  <li>Offline Storage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Multimedia Kit</h3>
<p>
  Its like the late nineties. When there was a shift in PC hardware
  vendors from selling separate multimedia kits ( external plug-ins ) to
  everything integrated and working out of the box. 
</p>
<p>
  What is possible with HTML5 multimedia but what are the pitfalls. What 
  all you should be careful about being too bleeding edge. This will answer
  in a small manner if Flash is going away or what are the alternatives. 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 Audio</li>
  <li>HTML5 Video</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bling Bling - HTML5 Showcase</h3>
<p>
  You have an idea what HTML5 is and what you might be able to build with it.
  This session will show you what are the coolest projects people are building
  currently. The latest, greatest working HTML5 code. Games with realistic
  physics, shiny media galleries and more. If you are still sitting on the 
  fence about the whole HTML5 hype this session will dazzle you and get you
  truly excited about what you can start building. 
</p>
