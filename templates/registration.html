  Your email and phone will <em>not</em> be sold to drooling spammers,
  much as they’d like to get their grubby hands on it. We hate them
  as much as you do. If you give us your number, one of the <a href="#team">team</a>
  will call to say hello when registrations are open. Mobile numbers will get
  an SMS reminder too.
